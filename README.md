# Numerical Differentiation Methods
**<h1>Purpose</h1>**  
In a circuit with impressed voltage , inductance  , and resistance  , as shown in Figure 1, Kirchhoffâ€™s voltage law gives the relationship E(t) = L * d/dt i(t) + R * i(t), Where i(t) is the current. This is due to the voltage difference induces on an inductance is proportional to the inductance value and the time derivative of the current flows through the inductance, i.e. VL = L d/dt i(t). On the other hand, the voltage difference on a resistance can be determined as VR(t) = R * i(t).
